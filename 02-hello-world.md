# (PART) Course content {.unnumbered}

# Hello world {#hello-world}

We will start off by showing you what is possible at the end of the class and by you running a fairly complex visualization code in your own environment.
The goal of this `Hello world` part is not to make you understand every bit of the code, but instead make you hungry for more.
We aim for you being able to code such a visualization from scratch at the end of our course.
To reach that goal, we will --- step by step --- introduce you to the most relevant facets of Data Science with R and the Tidyverse.
